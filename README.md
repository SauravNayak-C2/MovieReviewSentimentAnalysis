# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

This project dives into the fascinating world of natural language processing (NLP) to analyze sentiments from movie reviews. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the goal is to classify reviews into positive or negative categories and provide insights into audience opinions.

## Project Overview
This sentiment analysis project showcases:
- Text preprocessing to clean and prepare raw data.
- Feature extraction methods like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
- Machine learning model training using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or even Deep Learning models like LSTMs.
- Evaluation metrics to measure the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Visual representation of sentiment distribution and results.

## Features
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Run sentiment analysis with simple commands.
- **Versatile Approach**: Supports multiple models and techniques.
- **Performance Analysis**: Displays comprehensive metrics for model evaluation.
- **Visualization**: Provides charts and graphs to understand sentiment trends.
